# The Data
There are two datasets that I have used to work on my prototypes for my project so far. The first contains forty-three different types of food, ranging from vegetables and fruits to cheese and cows. There are also twenty-three columns that contain information of Kg CO2 per Kg of product based on land use, transportation,  farming, etc. It also contains data on eutrophication, which is when runoff from farms cause pollution in the surounding bodies of water. The data has the eutrophying emissinos in relation to other values such as Kg of product, 1000kcal, 100g of protein, etc. The data also contains information on water usage and greenhouse emissions in relation to those values as well.

The second data set contains information on what countries citizen's ate wiht information such as Kg of food per person per year. It also contains the total of CO2 in KG/year/person as well as Kg of CO2/person/year.

# The Methods
I have used simple plots in descending order. This is to help show which food product produces the most emissions based on factors such as Land or total emissions. I also sectioned the line graph when viewing total emissions to know what makes up the total. There is also an added vertical line in order to know where the average stands. 

The next method is a pie chart. Here, I created 3:
  1. All food products
  2. Vegan
  3. Non-Vegan(named meat for simplicity)
This was added in order to better see the impacts depending on your diet.

Next, I added a ridge plot using the new dataset. This was creted in order to better visualize the CO2 emissions distributed throughout all the countries in the data.

The final method I used for this was an interactive scatterplot that gives exact details when hovered over. Two of these were created:
  1. This was to visualize the amount of water needed (in Liters) per 1000Kcalories.
  2. This one was to visualize water (in Liters) needed for 100g of protein.
Both of these have a legend to seperate the two types of food(vegan/non-vegan).

At the end, I found a dataset in order to find out how much CO2 is released per Km. Then I did the math in order to see how many miles and for how many years you can drive until you produced as many emissions as a Cow, which the answer may be a shock.

# Hypothesis & Preliminary results
Working Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that in general, meat is the worst option for the environment in terms of CO2 and changing to a all/mostly meat free diet will be the best way to reduce our emissions and respect the environment more as consumers as well as farmers. 

With what I have now, I have come with some preliminary results on which types of foods and food products are best to reduce CO2 or water (based on Kcalorie or protein needs):

CO2 Reduction:
  1. Non-Vegan: If you want to continue eating meat, the best option is to avoid eating any forms of beef, including milk or cheese. Lamb/Mutton are also quite hazerdous in terms of CO2 emissions
  2. Vegan: This option is much safer as only a fraction of these products go above any non-vegan.

Water Reduction:
  1. 1000Kcal needed: For this section, chicken did the best in terms of water needed and emissions produced in the process. The best option for a vegan diet was oatmeal, potatoes, and root vegetables. However if water was not as much of concern, then there are other options that produce less emissions.
  2. 100g Protein needed: Again, Chicken reigns supreme here as well as keeping low emissions. The vegan diet, however, had a much harder time beating chicken in terms of water use. This is most likely due to more of these products needed in order to reach this 100g goal. The best ones here were the same three as above, however this time there are 9 that are above poultry in terms of water use instead of 6.
