# The Data
There are three datasets that I have used to work on the project so far. The first contains forty-three different types of food, ranging from vegetables and fruits to cheese and cows. There are also twenty-three columns that contain information of Kg CO2 per Kg of product based on land use, transportation,  farming, etc. It also contains data on eutrophication, which is when runoff from farms causes pollution in the surrounding bodies of water. The data has the eutrophying emissions in relation to other values such as Kg of product, 1000kcal, 100g of protein, etc. The data contains information on water usage and greenhouse emissions concerning those values as well.

The second data set contains information on what countries citizens ate with information such as Kg of food per person per year. It also contains the total of CO2 in KG/year/person as well as Kg of CO2/person/year.

The third contains data on different car makes, models, and types. This data also contained CO2 emissions in grams of CO2 per Km which I then had to convert to miles. 

# The Methods
I have used simple plots in descending order. This is to help show which food product produces the most emissions based on factors such as Land or total emissions. I also sectioned the line graph when viewing total emissions to know what makes up the total. There is also an added vertical line in order to know where the average stands. This first visual is to get an understanding of what goes into the emissions produced when growing these products.

The next method is a pie chart. Here, I created 3:
  1. All food products
  2. Vegan
  3. Non-Vegan(named meat for simplicity)
The second and third pie charts are there to better visualize how much a specific type of food creates more emissions than the rest. 

Next, I added a ridge plot using the new dataset. This was created to better visualize the CO2 emissions distributed throughout all the food included in the data.

Afterward, I used for this was an interactive scatterplot that gives exact details when hovered over. Two of these were created:
  1. This was to visualize the amount of water needed (in Liters) per 1000Kcalories.
  2. This one was to visualize water (in Liters) needed for 100g of protein.
Both of these have a legend to separate the two types of food(vegan/non-vegan).

I then found a dataset to find out how much CO2 is released per Km. With this data, I created a boxplot to see just how much the produced emissions range from car type. Then I did the math to see how many miles and for how many years you can drive until you produced as many emissions as a Cow, which the answer may be a shock.

# Hypothesis & Results
Working Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that in general, meat is the worst option for the environment in terms of CO2, and changing to an all or mostly meat-free diet will be the best way to reduce our emissions and respect the environment more as consumers as well as farmers. 

With what I have now, I have come with some results on which types of foods and food products are best to reduce CO2 or water (based on Kcalorie or protein needs):

CO2 Reduction:
  1. Non-Vegan: If you want to continue eating meat, the best option is to avoid eating any form of beef, including milk or cheese. Lamb/Mutton are also quite hazardous in terms of CO2 emissions
  2. Vegan: This option is much safer as only a fraction of these products go above any non-vegan.

Water Reduction:
  1. 1000Kcal needed: For this section, chicken did the best in terms of water needed and emissions produced in the process. The best option for a vegan diet was oatmeal, potatoes, and root vegetables. However, if water was not as much of a concern, then there are other options that produce fewer emissions.
  2. 100g Protein needed: Again, Chicken reigns supreme here as well as keeping low emissions. The vegan diet, however, had a much harder time beating chicken in terms of water use. This is most likely due to more of these products needed to reach this 100g goal. The best ones here were the same three as above, however, this time there are 9 that are above poultry in terms of water use instead of 6.

In order to further reduce your footprint, looking at the car box plot will tell you which vehicle class has the lowest produced emissions.
