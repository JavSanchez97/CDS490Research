# CDS490Research
Research Project for CDS490

The files here contain my steps through this project to try and find the most environmentally friendly food source. First I am trying to find which food source from the first dataset is the most dangerous to the environment in terms of CO2 production involved by how much land is used. Next, I worked on created a line plot that uses the first 8 columns in order to see which categories create the most CO2 for each product. Lastly, I created a pieplot in order to see total emissions created and to better visualize which causet the most problems.

Creating the pie plot did cause some confusion as it had too many products, so I then decided to narrow it down to vegan and non-vegan items to compare them against eachother. Here, it is easeier to tell which products create the biggest CO2 emissions per-category.

Lastly, I got a different dataset that contains data on the consumption of these foods and which cause the most CO2 and I created a ridge-plot in order to see which items create the most CO2 and visualize it in a way to easily compare to other items.
