# The Data
There are two datasets that I have used to work on my prototypes for my project so far. The first contains forty-three different types of food, ranging from vegetables and fruits to cheese and cows. There are also twenty-three columns that contain information of Kg CO2 per Kg of product based on land use, transportation,  farming, etc. It also contains data on eutrophication, which is when runoff from farms cause pollution in the surounding bodies of water. The data has the eutrophying emissinos in relation to other values such as Kg of product, 1000kcal, 100g of protein, etc. The data also contains information on water usage and greenhouse emissions in relation to those values as well.

The second data set contains information on what countries citizen's ate wiht information such as Kg of food per person per year. It also contains the total of CO2 in KG/year/person as well as Kg of CO2/person/year.


The files here contain my steps through this project to try and find the most environmentally friendly food source. First I am trying to find which food source from the first dataset is the most dangerous to the environment in terms of CO2 production involved by how much land is used. Next, I worked on created a line plot that uses the first 8 columns in order to see which categories create the most CO2 for each product. Lastly, I created a pieplot in order to see total emissions created and to better visualize which causet the most problems.

Creating the pie plot did cause some confusion as it had too many products, so I then decided to narrow it down to vegan and non-vegan items to compare them against eachother. Here, it is easeier to tell which products create the biggest CO2 emissions per-category.

Lastly, I got a different dataset that contains data on the consumption of these foods and which cause the most CO2 and I created a ridge-plot in order to see which items create the most CO2 and visualize it in a way to easily compare to other items.

Working Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that in general, meat is the worst option for the environment in terms of CO2 and changing to a all/mostly meat free diet will be the best way to reduce our emissions as consumers as well as farmers.
